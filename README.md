# Welcome to cogrammers!

**Our mission is to foster a community based around the simple idea that a tech education should be accessible, ongoing, and engaging.** We are based around the following pillars:

### Open source
Information is power, and information should be free. Cogrammers is radically transparent. Everything from the curriculum, the discussions, exams, company direction, and business plans should be transparent by default. Current students should feel just as encouraged to change the curriculum as staff or anyone else.

Closely tied is the idea that cogrammers is hackable. To fulfill our mission of being ongoing, we will cherish the idea of trying new ideas, quantifying their impact, and incorporating those concepts. Whether they're by us or a fork. From this iteration, cogrammers will be world-class.

### Community building
A core hypothesis of cogrammers is that the program should directly benefit all those involved, as well as the larger community. Students get an education, alumni grow their network, companies hire better employees, the community gets apps made for them, and more.

The community aspect is incredibly important. Cogrammers is more than just a technical handbook. Everything we do is designed to help all of us grow as individuals. By learning empathy, communication, and teamworking skills, we become better people. We become better cohort mates, and better community members.

### Inclusive by default
If our mission is to be accessible, we must also be inclusive. All people who want to, should be able to be cogrammers. Our society has many issues, some of them exasperated by the tech industry. Regardless, we will aspire to have this awareness in everything we do, in order to be as inclusive as possible.
